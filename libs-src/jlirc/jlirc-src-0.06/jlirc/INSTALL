Installation instructions for jlirc

Requirements

Linux:

	- a JDK (>= 1.2.2) (try http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/download-linux.html for Sun's Linux JDK)
	  is needed to compile and run jlirc (well, you probably wouldn't have downloaded
	  this stuff if you didn't want to compile and run java programs).

	- LIRC (http://www.lirc.org/) should be installed and running for you to be able
	  to use jlirc (there should be no problem compiling without it though)

Windows:
	- a JDK (>= 1.2.2)

	- WinLIRC (http://home.jtan.com/~jim/winlirc/) should be installed and running for you to be able
	  to use jlirc (there should be no problem compiling without it though)




Building and installing

On Linux:

	1) Edit Makefile and make sure that IDIRS points to your JNI header files
		(normally you should just have to change JDK_HOME, right at the top).

	2) make (will compile the java classes and the native code)

	make test (will run org.lirc.test.Irw which prints received signal
				to stdout, the lircd daemon must be running for this to work)

	make doc (will generate the API documentation).

	The java classes and the native code will be in the 'build'
	directory. You can copy the the 'org' directory to somewhere that's
	in your classpath, or add the build directory to your classpath.


On Windows:

	There is no Makefile for Windows, but you will only need the java
	classes if you are using windows, no native code.
	You need to compile the the java sources in src, something like:

	javac -d . src/org/lirc/*.java src/org/lirc/test/*.java src/org/lirc/util/*.java src/org/lirc/ui/*.java

	(haven't tried that, might need to change slashes to backslashes)

	The API documentation can be generated in a similar way, I assume that
	if you need the documentation, you know how to use javadoc. Should be something like this:

	javadoc -version -author -use -overview src/org/lirc/overview.html -d apidoc -sourcepath src org.lirc org.lirc.test org.lirc.util org.lirc.ui
